# Web stack debugging 3 :page_with_curl:
Web debugging is crucial for developers to identify and resolve issues in web applications. This post focuses on debugging a Wordpress website on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.
Logs may not always be sufficient for debugging, especially when unexpected errors occur or when logs lack necessary details.

### Key Steps in Web Debugging:
•	Review error logs generated by Apache and PHP.
•	Enable debugging mode in Wordpress for detailed error information.
•	Analyze plugins and themes for conflicts or errors.
•	Verify compatibility of Wordpress, plugins, and themes.
•	Check the integrity of the MySQL database.
•	Utilize developer tools in web browsers for insights.

Web debugging plays a vital role in resolving issues within Wordpress websites on LAMP stacks. By following a systematic approach, developers can ensure smooth web application functionality.

- Using strace, to find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once the issue is found, use Puppet (instead of Bash as previously done) to fix it and then automate it.

- Hint:
strace can attach to a current running process
You can use tmux to run strace in one window and curl in another one
