# Web stack debugging 3 :page_with_curl:
Web debugging is crucial for developers to identify and resolve issues in web applications. This post focuses on debugging a Wordpress website on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.
Logs may not always be sufficient for debugging, especially when unexpected errors occur or when logs lack necessary details.

### Key Steps in Web Debugging:
•	Review error logs generated by Apache and PHP.
•	Enable debugging mode in Wordpress for detailed error information.
•	Analyze plugins and themes for conflicts or errors.
•	Verify compatibility of Wordpress, plugins, and themes.
•	Check the integrity of the MySQL database.
•	Utilize developer tools in web browsers for insights.

Web debugging plays a vital role in resolving issues within Wordpress websites on LAMP stacks. By following a systematic approach, developers can ensure smooth web application functionality.

## About :pen:
- Using strace, find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once you find the issue, fix it and then automate it using Puppet (instead of using Bash as you were previously doing).

- Hint:
strace can attach to a current running process
You can use tmux to run strace in one window and curl in another one

-Requirements:
Your 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp file must contain Puppet code
You can use whatever Puppet resource type you want for you fix

## File Description:
  * [0-strace_is_your_friend.pp](./0-strace_is_your_friend.pp): Puppet manifest
  that fixes a typo error causing a WordPress application being served by an Apache
  web server to fail.
  * Usage: `puppet apply 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp`
