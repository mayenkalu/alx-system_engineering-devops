# Web Stack Debugging 4:page_with_curl: 

## About :bulb:

This project provided me with valuable insights into the art of debugging webstacks within isolated containers. I gained hands-on experience in identifying and resolving issues to restore the web stack to a fully functional state. For each task assigned, I took it a step further by crafting meticulous scripts that automated the necessary commands, streamlining the process of fixing the web stack efficiently.

## Task Description

* [0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp](./0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp): 
  Puppet manifest that increases the amount of traffic an Apache web server can effectively handle.

* [1-user_limit.pp](./1-user_limit.pp): 
  Puppet manifest that changes the operating system configuration so that it is possible to login with the user `holberton` and open a file
  without error.
