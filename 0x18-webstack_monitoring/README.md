# Webstack Monitoring :page_with_curl:
Monitoring is crucial for webstacks to ensure optimal performance, availability, and security. It serves two main purposes:
•	Performance Optimization: Monitoring identifies bottlenecks, improving load times and user experience.
•	Availability and Reliability: Detecting outages and issues promptly minimizes downtime.

**The two main areas of Monitoring:**
•	Infrastructure Monitoring: Tracks server health, resource usage, and network latency.
•	Application Monitoring: Monitors response times, error rates, and database queries.

**Access Logs in a web server (e.g., Nginx):** These are records details provide valuable information about incoming requests, including IP address, timestamp, URL, status code and other relevant metadata. They help track user activity, analyze traffic patterns, detect potential security threats, and troubleshoot issues related to server requests and responses.

**Error Logs in a web server (e.g., Nginx):** Captures information about any errors or exceptions that occur during the processing of requests, providing insights on server-side errors like HTTP error codes (e.g., 500, 404). Assists in diagnosing issues and troubleshooting for improved website stability and functionality.

Webstack monitoring ensures optimal performance, availability, and security by tracking infrastructure and application metrics. Access and error logs provide valuable insights for analysis and issue resolution.
